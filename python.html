<p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
    Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant 
    indentation.[32]

    Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
     programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
     object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
      included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]</p>
